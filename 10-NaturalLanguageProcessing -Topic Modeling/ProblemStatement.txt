Say you are a product manager at Amazon and want to understand what features of a recently released product (say Amazon Alexa) customers are talking about in their reviews. 
Say you are able to identify that 50% people talk about the hardware, 30% talk about features related to music, while 20% talk about the packaging of the product. 
That would be pretty useful and cool, right? 

This assignment builds LDA models in Python, starting with identifying the topics in Amazon Alexa's customer reviews.
